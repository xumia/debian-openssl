openssl (0.9.7g-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    * Added support for proxy certificates according to RFC 3820.
      Because they may be a security thread to unaware applications,
      they must be explicitely allowed in run-time.  See

      failure and freeing up memory if a failure occurs.
    * Perform some character comparisons of different types in X509_NAME_cmp:
      this is needed for some certificates that reencode DNs into UTF8Strings
      (in violation of RFC3280) and can't or wont issue name rollover
      certificates.
  * corrected watchfile

     Stop out of bounds reads in the ASN1 code when presented with
     invalid tags (CAN-2003-0543 and CAN-2003-0544).
     Free up ASN1_TYPE correctly if ANY type is invalid (CAN-2003-0545).
     If verify callback ignores invalid public key errors don't try to check
     certificate signature with the NULL public key.
   - In ssl3_accept() (ssl/s3_srvr.c) only accept a client certificate
     if the server requested one: as stated in TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.0
     specifications.
  * more minor upstream bugfixes

openssl (0.9.7b-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * upstream security fix
   - Countermeasure against the Klima-Pokorny-Rosa extension of
     Bleichbacher's attack on PKCS #1 v1.5 padding: treat
     a protocol version number mismatch like a decryption error
     in ssl3_get_client_key_exchange (ssl/s3_srvr.c). (CAN-2003-0131)
    (closes: #189087)
   - Turn on RSA blinding by default in the default implementation
     to avoid a timing attack. Applications that don't want it can call
     RSA_blinding_off() or use the new flag RSA_FLAG_NO_BLINDING.
     They would be ill-advised to do so in most cases. (CAN-2003-0147)
   - Change RSA blinding code so that it works when the PRNG is not
     seeded (in this case, the secret RSA exponent is abused as
     an unpredictable seed -- if it is not unpredictable, there
     is no point in blinding anyway).  Make RSA blinding thread-safe
     by remembering the creator's thread ID in rsa->blinding and
     having all other threads use local one-time blinding factors
     (this requires more computation than sharing rsa->blinding, but
     avoids excessive locking; and if an RSA object is not shared
     between threads, blinding will still be very fast).

openssl (0.9.7a-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * upstream Security fix
    - In ssl3_get_record (ssl/s3_pkt.c), minimize information leaked
      via timing by performing a MAC computation even if incorrrect
      block cipher padding has been found.  This is a countermeasure
      against active attacks where the attacker has to distinguish
      between bad padding and a MAC verification error. (CAN-2003-0078)
